# Olympic Medal Prediction:Machine Learning Project
This project walks you through the full process of building a beginner machine learning project. The goal is to predict the number of medals a country will win based on historical and current data from the Olympic Games.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working machine learning project using Python and Jupyter, covering steps such as forming a hypothesis, preparing data, training the model, and evaluating the model's performance.

# Project Steps
The general structure of this project follows these machine learning steps:

Form a hypothesis: What factors might influence the number of medals a country wins?

Find and explore the data: Work with Olympic datasets to extract relevant information.

Reshape the data: If needed, modify the data to predict the target variable (number of medals).

Clean the data: Prepare the data to be used for machine learning.

Pick an error metric: Choose a metric to measure the modelâ€™s performance.

Split the data: Separate the data into training and testing sets.

Train a model: Use machine learning techniques to train a model that predicts the number of medals.

Evaluate the model: Assess how well the model performs using the chosen error metric.

Installation and Setup
